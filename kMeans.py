# PROBLEM: Because k-means is a clustering algorithm, not a classifier,
#   the cluster labels are not lined up with the data labels -- e.g.
#   the third cluster is not likely to be the third label (2).  So, we
#   have to decide which cluster corresponds to which label.
# SOLUTION: Go through and count, for each cluster, which digit is most
#   likely to fall in that cluster.  Then, associate that cluster with
#   that digit.
# ASSUMPTION: This will actually result in a single distinct digit assigned
#   to each cluster; i.e. that the same digit isn't most common in two
#   clusters and/or two digits aren't both tied for most common and/or
#   that each digit is actually most common in some cluster.

# After the loop runs, the i-th entry in this is the digit for the i-th cluster.

    # Assign this label to the cluster that has the most of this label.
    finalPreds[label] = counts.index(max(counts))
# Go through all the predictions and change cluster numbers to digit labels.
for i in range(len(predY)):
    predY[i] = finalPreds[predY[i]]

# Now, see how accurate we were.
